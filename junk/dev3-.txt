1) what if an employee left the company and rehired for same role and department then there would be two records of them with different emp id , is this a good scenario to tackle? 

2) For payroll tax deductions we will have a tax_deductions table with fields: state, tax percentage, with that we can caluculate tax like this : 
 SELECT E_id,
            CASE
                WHEN salary BETWEEN 0 AND 11600 THEN (salary * 0.10)
                WHEN salary BETWEEN 11601 AND 47150 THEN (salary * 0.12)
                WHEN salary BETWEEN 47151 AND 100525 THEN (salary * 0.22)
                WHEN salary BETWEEN 100526 AND 191950 THEN (salary * 0.24)
                WHEN salary BETWEEN 191951 AND 243725 THEN (salary * 0.32)
                WHEN salary BETWEEN 243726 AND 609350 THEN (salary * 0.35)
                WHEN salary > 609351  THEN (salary * 0.37)
            END AS Federal_deducation
        FROM payroll.employee
    )
    SELECT e.E_id, e.E_name, e.Designation, d.dep_name, e.Salary AS Gross_salary, 
           (Federal_deducation + (e.salary * td.state_tax / 100) + (e.salary * 0.0765)) AS Deductable,
           (e.salary - ((Federal_deducation + (e.salary * td.state_tax / 100) + (e.salary * 0.0765))) + e.Bonus) AS Net_Salary
    FROM payroll.Employee e
    JOIN payroll.Department d ON e.dep_id = d.dep_id
    JOIN payroll.tax_deductions td ON e.State = td.state 
    JOIN salary_bracket sb ON e.E_id = sb.E_id
    WHERE e.E_id = %s

here we are trying to have a tax bracket to know the federal tax and combining it with state tax based on state they are working for , 

3)Department Table in  deparment table there can be more than one manager for a deparment right what are your thought on this ? 

4)For payroll table we might not need any tax deduction field and net salary i would like to generate them on fly. 

5) Few doubts on these tables :
Access Control Table
This table manages the different roles and access levels within the organization.

Field Name	Data Type	Description
role_id	INT (PK)	Unique identifier for the role
role_name	VARCHAR(50)	Name of the role (e.g., HR, Manager, Employee)
access_level	INT	Numeric value representing access level (e.g., 1 = admin, 2 = manager)
5. Employee Role Mapping Table
This table links employees to specific roles for access control purposes.

Field Name	Data Type	Description
employee_id	INT (FK)	Links to the Employee Table
role_id	INT (FK)	Links to the Access Control Table
start_date	DATE	Date the role was assigned to the employee
end_date	DATE	Date the role ended (if applicable)

Keep in mind that i need to have user_name and password for each employee to access their respective dashboards to do actions on based on their roles.
Don't mind this access issue as you have given me authentication table that's good to go.
So do modification to tables according to that also.

6)For this audit table we might have a scenario where more than one field of a emp could have been modified how would you track in that scenario?
Make changes as per that complex scenarios also.

7) Authentication Table don't you think that there needs to be a link to the employee  table how is the linking happens if an employee wants to 
change thier passwords.

8) sensitive information  Security Table (for sensitive data) explain with an example between authentication table and sensitive table ,

I am not getting the link and need for this .


IMPORTANT NOTE:
BASED ON ABOVE FEEDBACK AND INFORMATION DO CHANGES TO THE DATABASE SCHEMA GIVEN,

ALSO TRY TO GIVE ME ANSWER FOR QUESITONS THAT I ASKED.
